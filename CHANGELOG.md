# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **ovmem: provider + model picker.** The installer now asks for a provider and a chat/embedding model, showing the price of each (USD per 1M tokens) from `extensions/ovmem/models.json`.
  - **OpenAI** — `gpt-4o-mini` / `gpt-4.1-mini` / `gpt-4o`; embeddings `text-embedding-3-small` / `-large`.
  - **AWS Bedrock** (via OpenViking's LiteLLM backends) — chat `nova-lite` / `claude-3-5-haiku` / `claude-3-5-sonnet` / `claude-sonnet-4-5`; embeddings `titan-embed-v2` / `cohere-embed-v3` / `titan-embed-v1`. Auth is a Bedrock API key (bearer token) + region; the installer adds `boto3` to the OpenViking venv and injects the credentials into the server env. (Beta — not yet run against a live AWS account in CI.)
- Headless install via `OVMEM_PROVIDER` / `OVMEM_CHAT_MODEL` / `OVMEM_EMBED_MODEL` + the provider credential.
- `ovmem doctor` now reports the configured provider, chat and embedding models.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-19

### Changed
- `install.sh` now offers to open the toolchain manager at the end of **every** install path — including `curl … | bash`. It reads the prompt from `/dev/tty` (the controlling terminal) instead of stdin, so the menu works even when the script is piped. Headless/CI runs (no terminal) just print the command.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Toolchain manager** (`make menu`, `scripts/leopold-menu.sh`): a data-driven interactive menu over an extension registry (`extensions/`). Each extension declares `extension.json` + `manage.sh` (`detect | status | install | update | remove | doctor`). Generalizes the one-off gstack prompt into install/manage for any companion component.
- **gstack** and **ovmem** registry extensions. `install.sh` now vendors `extensions/` into `~/.claude/leopold/`.
- **ovmem extension** — autonomous RAG long-term memory (OpenViking + 4 hooks). Installer ships the OpenAI profile (validates the key against chat + embeddings, writes `ov.conf`, wires the 4 hooks idempotently, verifies via a round-trip). Linux + macOS; native Windows is gated with a "use WSL" message. Fully-local Ollama/GGUF profiles are still TODO.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- `leopold doctor` (`make doctor`, `/leopold-doctor`): diagnoses the install — skills, hooks and their wiring, gstack, the driver toolchain, and update status.

### Changed
- Auto-release CI: npm publish is now idempotent (skips a version already on npm).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

Initial public release.

### Added
- In-session engine: `/leopold-brief`, `/leopold-run`, `/leopold-status`, `/leopold-stop`.
- Stop hook (autonomous continuity) and PreToolUse hook (git lock), with behavior tests.
- Brief artifacts (MISSION, CHARTER, GUARDRAILS, PLAN, DECISIONS) and the decision protocol.
- SDK driver (`packages/driver/`, npm `leopold-driver`): persistent conductor + fresh workers per item, conductor/worker status protocol, charter-grounded decisions, git-locked `canUseTool`, notifications. Uses your Claude Code auth (no API key).
- Optional gstack integration (detect + offer; never bundled) with planning hooks in `/leopold-brief`.
- Run hygiene: clears `STOP` + git opt-in tokens on stop; `on_finish: keep | archive`; single-run-per-checkout guard with worktree guidance for parallelism.
- Install paths: one-command `curl | bash`, `install.sh`, `make`, and a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/`).
- Docs site (MkDocs Material + Mermaid) and CI.
